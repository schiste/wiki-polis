## Step 1 — Run Polis + Particiapi locally ✓ (in progress)

**Goal:** Validate the approach before touching any infrastructure.

- [x] Clone with `--recurse-submodules`; fix PostgreSQL 18 volume path; set auth disabled + dev mode
- [x] Base stack running: Polis + Particiapi + PostgreSQL
- [x] Particiapi API responding; conversation creation and retrieval confirmed
- [x] Statement submission and voting confirmed end-to-end via API
- [x] Web components evaluated from source — events, CSS parts, integration pattern documented

**Setup notes:** `v2/cache/local-setup.md`, `v2/reference/particiapi-api.md`, `v2/reference/web-components.md`

**Deliverable:** ✓ Approach confirmed. Particiapi API works, voting loop works, web components provide sufficient styling and event hooks for our integration.

---

## Step 4 — Build Flask app v2 ✓

- [x] Start fresh Flask app (builds on v1 structure)
- [x] Clean data model: Conversation (with 4 phase toggle fields), Participant, Participation, ConversationInvite, AdminRole, FeaturedStatement, Argument, ArgumentVote
- [x] Replace PolisClient with session-cookie proxy (browser ↔ Flask ↔ Particiapi; `pa_session` cookie rename pattern)
- [x] Wikimedia OAuth flow (port from v1); dev-login bypass when OAuth not configured
- [x] Conversation listing: active / archived / available / moderating sections
- [x] Accept flow with coolname pseudonym selection (5 options + re-roll)
- [x] Conversation page: `<pa-conversation>` + `<pa-statement>` + `<pa-vote-button>`; "propose alternative" prompt after each vote
- [x] Admin panel: conversations, phase toggles (S/P/A/R), roles, invites
- [x] Confirmed end-to-end locally: dev-login → accept → statement submission → vote → Polis recorded `{"value": -1}`
- [x] `polis_admin.py` split into `PolisParticipantClient` (Particiapi HTTP reads) and `PolisServerClient` (Polis admin API + direct Postgres); raises `PolisParticipantError` / `PolisServerError`
- [x] Test suite (74 tests) green: unit, integration, security, reveal, polis_admin

**Particiapi vote API:** `PUT /api/conversations/<id>/votes/<tid>` with `{"value": <int>}` (AGREE=-1, NEUTRAL=0, DISAGREE=1). Requires `@session_required` (web component handles session creation via `POST /api/session?create=true`).

**Deliverable:** ✓ End-to-end confirmed locally against particiapp-docker stack.

**Next:** Deploy to VPS (Step 2) then wire Flask to it (Step 4 → prod).

## Step 4b — Security & privacy hardening ✓

Security, code quality, and computational social science reviews conducted (2026-05-12); all approved items implemented.

**Security**
- [x] CSRF protection (Flask-WTF) on all HTML forms; proxy route exempt with Sec-Fetch-Site / Origin validation as compensating control
- [x] Rate limiting (Flask-Limiter) on login, accept, and pseudonym endpoints; mid-flow requests never interrupted
- [x] Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`) via `after_request`
- [x] Open redirect fixed in `redirect_to` form fields (`urllib.parse` host comparison)
- [x] Dev login triple-guarded: `app.debug` AND `DEV_LOGIN_USER` env var AND not on Toolforge

**Code quality**
- [x] `get_polis_stats` rewritten with direct psycopg2 connection (replaces `docker exec`; no string-interpolated SQL)
- [x] `_current_participant()` cached on Flask `g` (one DB hit per request)
- [x] `_is_emailable()` cached in session at OAuth callback time (not on every accept page load)
- [x] N+1 query in index view eliminated with `joinedload`
- [x] Pseudonym race condition handled with `IntegrityError` catch instead of pre-check

**Conversation lifecycle**
- [x] `active` toggle split into **Pause** (reversible, no reveal clock) and **Close permanently** (irreversible, starts clock) with confirmation dialog and prominent warning
- [x] `Conversation.paused` column added (migration applied)
- [x] Paused conversations hidden from available / public listings; conversation page shows "temporarily paused"

**Privacy & pseudonymity**
- [x] `link_based` access policy removed from code and UI
- [x] Opt-in identity reveal: `Participation.public_username` + `revealed_at` columns (migration applied)
- [x] `Conversation.closed_at` set on permanent close; drives reveal timeline
- [x] Reveal routes (`GET/POST /c/<slug>/reveal`) with cooldown gate, opt-in window gate, irreversible-warning form
- [x] Voluntary public reveals are permanent; app no longer nullifies `public_username` / `revealed_at` after the opt-in window
- [x] Minimum-N warning on results (< 25 participants): shown above public results, does not hide results
- [x] Consent copy on accept page updated to reflect platform-wide pseudonym uniqueness and operator data retention
- [ ] **TODO: open GitHub issue** — audit consistency of pseudonymity / vote privacy messaging across all user-facing surfaces (accept page, conversation view, results page, reveal flow). Ensure the platform's promises (votes are private, pseudonym is per-platform, identity reveal is opt-in post-close) are communicated clearly and consistently everywhere a participant might wonder.

## Step 4c — Frontend fixes (2026-05-13)

Web component integration bugs found and fixed during browser testing:

**Fixed**
- [x] `base="/proxy/particiapi"` relative URL crashed `new URL()` in `ConversationClient` — changed to `{{ request.url_root }}proxy/particiapi`
- [x] `#fetchConversation` missing `credentials: "include"` — session cookie not sent, proxy returned login redirect, JSON parse crashed
- [x] `urlWithPath()` replaced entire pathname, discarding the `/proxy/particiapi` prefix from all API URLs
- [x] Importmap placed in `<body>` inside conditional block — moved to `<head>` via `{% block head %}`, spec-compliant
- [x] CSS selector typo `pa-statement:state(no-statements)` → `no-statement` (singular)
- [x] `<pa-vote-button type="pass">` is not a valid type (silently fell back to neutral) — changed to `type="neutral"`
- [x] Vote buttons stayed visible while propose-prompt was active — user could accidentally vote on next statement; now hidden during propose step
- [x] "Skip" button relabelled "Next →"; submit button relabelled "Submit & next"

**Open**
- [x] **Bug 4 (high):** `particiappstatechange` listener added to conversation.html — shows a visible error message when state is `error`, hides vote UI. `unauthenticated` state handled implicitly (proxy prevents it in normal flow).
- [ ] **Bug 8 (low):** The `<pa-login-button>` popup flow opens `loginURL = base + /auth/login` which is not a valid Flask route through the proxy. The popup auth flow is incompatible with the proxy architecture. Remove or hide `<pa-login-button>` if it ever gets added, or document that Wikimedia OAuth fully replaces it.

---

## Step 4d — UX improvements + documentation screenshots ✓ (2026-05-14)

**Voting flow redesign**
- [x] Agree/Pass/Disagree now select-and-highlight rather than immediately submitting; Submit button activates once a choice is made
- [x] "Have a better way to put this?" propose box is always visible alongside the vote selection (not a post-vote interstitial), with a full-width amber-bordered textarea
- [x] If propose box has content on Submit, shows inline confirm: "Also share alternate phrasing?" → **Yes, suggest it** (submits statement + vote) / **No, just my vote**
- [x] Hidden `pa-vote-button` / `pa-submit-button` elements handle actual API submission via programmatic `.click()`

**Voting flow — design handoff (2026-05-14/15)**
- [x] Two screen modes: **idle** (full card: header + pa-statement + vote buttons + dashed propose inside) and **propose** (slim card: voted badge + compose form below)
- [x] Vote is a single click — no Submit step; immediately fires API vote and switches to propose mode
- [x] Voted badge in propose header: ✓ YOU VOTED [AGREE/PASS/DISAGREE] + change link; color-keyed to vote type
- [x] Compose form below card: starts open; submit disabled until textarea has content; submitted state uses amber/spot palette
- [x] Clicking idle propose affordance also enters propose mode (compose form, no voted badge)
- [x] Propose affordance inside idle card: dashed amber button, margin-top 18px from vote buttons

**Voting flow — remaining from design handoff**
- [x] **Progress row not populated**: Fixed in PR #21. Listens to `particiappstatementschange` (poll cycles) and `particiappstatechange` `'loaded'` (initial load via `conv.client.statements`); builds `.vote-seg` elements and shows done/total counts.
- [x] **Statement number removed**: `STATEMENT · #N` was dropped — statement order is session-specific and random (Fisher-Yates shuffle in `particiapp-web-client.js` → `#fetchStatements`, then re-sorted meta → seed → user-submitted), so a sequence number is meaningless across users. Label stays as plain `STATEMENT`. No information-gain routing is implemented yet (described aspirationally in `spec_functional-design.md`).

**Accept / join page**
- [x] Rewritten as plain-English "how it works" intro — less legalistic
- [x] Privacy & data handling moved into a foldable `<details>` section with placeholder text (to be replaced before public launch)
- [x] Notification preferences section clarifies these are best-effort and delivery is not guaranteed

**Admin**
- [x] Grant global admin: dropdown replaced with free-text Wikimedia username input; error shown if account not found

**Visual**
- [x] v2 badge removed from header
- [x] `FeaturedStatement.statement_text` nullable field added — Particiapi fallback when API is unavailable; used by screenshot seed

**Documentation screenshots**
- [x] `.claude/screenshot.py`: seeds isolated DB, starts Flask in dev mode, takes 7 retina screenshots via Playwright, saves to `docs/screenshots/`
- [x] Screenshots committed: home (logged-out + in), accept, vote, arguments, results, reveal

**Bug fixes**
- [x] Jinja2 `len()` → `|length` filter in `conversation.html` (Python built-ins not available in Jinja2 sandbox)
- [x] Reveal consent label: wrapped text in `<span>` so `<strong>` elements don't become separate flex items

**Simulation**
- [x] `simulate_cats_vs_dogs.py`: Flask registration now uses SQLAlchemy directly (no HTTP dev-login needed); `--flask-url` CLI argument added

---

## Step 4f — Bug fixes and local dev improvements (2026-05-15)

**Voting flow fixes (PRs #15, #17)**
- [x] Propose mode: statement text now stays visible and pre-fills textarea after voting (#1)
- [x] Removed "You'll vote first →" promise — Particiapi 403s self-votes so it could never be fulfilled (#16)
- [x] Button labels: "Nothing to propose" → "The current wording is good as it is"; "Submit & next" → "Submit my version as alternative"
- [x] Submit button greyed out until textarea differs from original text

**Admin fixes (PR #18)**
- [x] Featured statements admin: confirmed table now shows statement text (fetched from Particiapi on add/confirm; backfilled on page load for older rows) (#8)

**Local dev setup (PR #20)**
- [x] `v2/guide_local-dev.md`: full setup guide for native Flask + Docker backend
- [x] `particiapp-docker/docker-compose.local.yaml` (gitignored): exposes postgres to host on configurable port (`POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`)
- [x] `POLIS_DATABASE_URL` set in `v2/.env`; system suggestions and Polis stats now work locally (#9 / #19)
- [x] SQL scope bug in `get_featured_candidates` fixed (mixed comma + explicit JOIN) (#19)

---

## Step 5 — Featured statements + argument mapping tab (defer until Step 4 is community-tested)

### Design decisions (agreed 2026-05-13)

**Featured statement curation:** system suggests group-representative statements (high within-group agree rate, cross-group variance) + seed proposals always surfaced. Admin confirms. Falls back to manual-by-tid when `POLIS_DATABASE_URL` unavailable.

**Argument submission:** one pro + one con per participant per featured statement (DB-enforced via `UniqueConstraint('featured_statement_id', 'proposer_id', 'side')`). Two-column Pro | Con layout. Joined participants only (must have pseudonym for this conversation).

**Importance voting mechanic (threshold-gated, K-approval):**
- Voting method stored on `Conversation.argument_vote_method` (default `'kApproval'`) + `argument_vote_data` JSON (default `{'K': 2}`)
- Before a participant can cast importance votes they must complete a "contribute-or-skip" gate:
  - For each side (pro and con), they either submit an argument OR click "nothing to add"
  - Must complete both sides before voting on either
  - Gate state stored in `ArgumentSideState` (`skipped=True` for "nothing to add"; proposed state derived from `Argument` table directly)
- Once gated in: participant casts **K votes per side** (K=2 by default) on the arguments they find **most important** (terminology settled: "most important" — matches Citizens' Assembly practice; avoids persuasion framing of "convincing" and subjectivity of "meaningful")
- Votes are whole (1 per argument, row presence = approval) — spending both votes on the same argument is not allowed
- `ArgumentVote.value` is nullable: `NULL` for kApproval (presence = vote), integer rank for future ranked voting

**Data model (current — all tables already in db.py):**
- `Argument`: `proposer_id` nullable (NULL = seeded, no human author). `UniqueConstraint('featured_statement_id', 'proposer_id', 'side')` — SQL NULL semantics exempt seeds from uniqueness, allowing multiple seeds per (FS, side).
- `ArgumentVote`: `UniqueConstraint('argument_id', 'participant_id')`. `value` nullable integer (NULL for kApproval, rank for ranking). 2-per-side cap enforced at app level, not DB level.
- `ArgumentSideState`: one row per `(participant_id, featured_statement_id, side)`. Dual-purpose: `skipped` boolean (skip-gate) + `argument_order` JSON list of argument IDs (randomised display order, stable per participant, new arguments inserted at a random position on first encounter).

**Gate check per side** (proposed OR skipped):
```python
from db import Argument, ArgumentSideState

gate_passed = bool(
    Argument.query.filter_by(proposer_id=participant.id, featured_statement_id=fs.id, side=side).first()
    or
    ArgumentSideState.query.filter_by(
        participant_id=participant.id, featured_statement_id=fs.id, side=side, skipped=True).first()
)
```

### Checklist

- [x] Cluster analysis query (`get_featured_candidates`) — seeds first, then by agree rate; falls back gracefully when `POLIS_DATABASE_URL` absent
- [x] Admin page: `/admin/conversations/<id>/featured` — suggest + confirm + manual add + remove
- [x] Admin tile on conversation detail page
- [x] Argument tab read view: two-column Pro | Con per featured statement
- [x] Argument submission form (inline, one per side per FS)
- [x] "Nothing to add" skip button per side (creates/updates `ArgumentSideState` with `skipped=True`)
- [x] `ArgumentSideState` creation on first side view: randomise `argument_order`; append new arguments at random position on encounter
- [x] Importance voting UI: "Select the K most important arguments" prompt; unlocks when side ≥ K args AND participant gate-passed both sides
- [x] Importance vote POST route (K-cap enforced in app; unvote supported)
- [x] Moderator delete of arguments
- [x] Hash-aware tab restore (`#tab-arguments` after all argument form redirects)
- [x] Phrasing settled: **"most important"** (matches Citizens' Assembly practice)

## Codebase refactor — blueprint decomposition ✓ (2026-06-02)

Decomposed the ~1,300-line `_register_routes` closure in `app.py` into Flask blueprints,
per the audit's refactor plan (#94). Steps 1–4 landed earlier (PR #88); steps 5–9 completed
here. Every step was a **behavior-preserving** relocation — handler bodies verified
byte-identical (AST), zero test-assertion changes. `_register_routes` cyclomatic complexity
**177 → 33**.

- **#90 / #89** (PR #97) — lifted 5 non-route helpers to module level; deduped the three
  statement-text fetch blocks into one `_statement_text_map()`.
- **#91** (PR #98) — extracted the Particiapi proxy + statement-submit into `proxy_bp`
  (the `@csrf.exempt` + `_validate_same_origin` compensating control preserved). Also added
  `synthetic_traffic.py` (a proxy soak/load harness driving a deployed instance through the
  real Flask stack) and a runbook section documenting staging topology + a 5xx-investigation
  playbook.
- **#92** (PR #99) — extracted the ~23 `/admin/…` routes into `admin_bp` (both auth
  conventions — `@admin_required` vs `_require_mod_for_conv` — kept distinct; CSRF retained).
- **#93** (PR #100) — extracted the participant accept / conversation / argument / reveal
  routes into `participant_bp`. Auth / OAuth / index / logout / health / dev-login stay in
  `_register_routes` (they close over its locals).

Each step shipped alone with a senior + security review (cross-reviewed); #91 was soak-tested
and #91/#92/#93 staging-verified. Test suite grew 120 → 134 (promoted helper-characterization
tests + an admin-template smoke test).
